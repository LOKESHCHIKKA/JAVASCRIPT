// DOM (Document Object Model)
// BOM (Browser Object Model)
// DOM is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree of nodes or a nested data structure. DOM is used to dynamically update the content,layout, and visual appearance of documents.
// BOM is a set of objects and methods that provide access to the browser's functionality, such as the window object, the document object, and the navigator object. BOM is used to interact with the browser, such as opening and closing windows, setting the title of a window, and getting information about the browser.
